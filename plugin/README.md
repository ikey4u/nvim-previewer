# nvim plugin wrapper for neovim

The default CSS file `nvim-previewer-github.css` in this directory is from [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)
with a few customizations. As a result, all copyrights are reserved to the original author.
I use metata data from Cargo to find project related files, that is why I rename this file.
